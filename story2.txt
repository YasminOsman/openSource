Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided in a berry tree which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife.
Monkey wanted to make a cloth for himself using crocodile skin. He slowly started trying to befriend the crocodile by feeding him the berries. The berries were delicious and the crocodile liked it. Now after some time, the monkey started poisoning the berries. This would be much worse if I wrote it.
